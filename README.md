DecorPhotos
===========
# What's for ?
fun... what else ?

# Usage

*DecorPhotos* is provided as an executable file, a starkit (.kit file)
 or source code.

Actually, there's no make file for the source code... first lines in
*main.tcl* explain how to produce the starkit.

So it's convenient to use the executable file, named
**dphoto-x.x-x86_64** in the latest version branch.

To use it, you'll have to run *GNU/linux* on an *amd64* machine. You
give right permissions for the file to be executed and let's rock !

Is there a way to produce exe for others arch ? Indeed yes... my todo
list is rather complete, you know...

# Tools

*DecorPhotos*'s source code uses **Tcl/Tk** with *TclMagick* to
produce these fantastic image effects :) and [*qrencode*](speedata.github.io/luaqrcode/).

No internationalisation is yet provided but... never give up on a dream ;)
